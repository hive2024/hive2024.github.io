# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  generate: true
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/room_open.webp
    - images/success.webp
    - images/vip1.webp
    - images/vip2.webp
    - images/vip3.webp
    - images/vip4.webp
    - images/vip5.webp
    - images/vip6.webp
    - images/only2.webp
    - images/only3.webp
    - images/only4.webp
    - images/only5.webp
    - images/only6.webp
    - images/share_logo.webp
    - images/avatar.webp
    - images/vip_fill.webp
    - images/telegram.webp
    - images/whatsapp.webp
    - images/messeger.webp

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
